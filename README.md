# GenerativePixelFire
This is a project that simulates natural fire, and can render it to pixel art for easy animation.

Built in Processing 3.5.4, and requires this environment to run. (Get processing at: https://processing.org/)


Make sure you place "FireGenerator.pde" and the "data" folder both inside the same folder, and name that folder "FireGenerator".


Key functions:

Right Mouse Button - Draw flame

N - Import new flame palette

S - Start/stop recording flame animation

B - Set background to first color in palette (disables trancparency)

Q - Exit the program


For adding color palettes, simply use the file explorer window to select any 1 pixel high x pixel wide .png file.
